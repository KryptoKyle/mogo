## Overview 

Mogo Finance Technology Inc. (Mogo) is a Vancouver-based financial technology company. Their mission is to provide Canadian millennials with a variety of financial instruments to manage and take control of their financial health.

## Origin

The company was founded in 2003 by David Feller. David Feller currently serves as the Chief Executive Officer and Chair of the Board of Directors. The inspiration to help young Canadians pay off debt at lower rates came from David’s own struggles to pay down credit debt while in College. Mogo has raised over $200 millions in funding over 5 rounds. In 2014 Mogo’s venture round raised $635,000 and later that year the series B round raised $1.5 million.

As consumers continue to move to a more convenient digital mortgage experience, Mogo is clearly positioned as one of the industry's innovators and leaders."  As of June 30th 2020, Mogo has reported a member base of over 1,000,000 users and is seeing continued growth throughout 2020. The growth was driven by enhancements to the existing products and value proposition. The company plans to continue its strong user base growth by ramping up marketing efforts in the coming months. Mogo has a 4.3/5 star rating and ranks #34 in Financial Apps on the Apple App Store and was featured in Appple’s 2019 “Apps We Love”. 

## Recommendations

I foresee future growth in the cryptocurrency market and my recommendation for Mogo would be to  expand their MogoCrypto offerings and capabilities. Mogo currently offers users the ability to buy and trade Bitcoin only. Offering other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Chainlink or other top 10 coins could attract more users to the app. Mogo should also develop a payment solution for MogoCrypto using the customers cryptocurrencies to pay off  loans or mortgages that are with the Mogo platform.
